## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

ðŸ‘‰ First time that I used the 'background-image' with the linear-gradient and also first time I created a section devider like this.

ðŸ‘‰ I liked using the picture-element in this way for the desktop media-query without css. Using the picture-element and the srcset attribute also ensures that only the necessary images are loaded depending on the screen size.

ðŸ‘‰I tried to get a smooth transition between the different output sizes. With trial and error I came to the conclusion that if you give an element a max-width and centre it with margin-left and margin-right â€˜autoâ€™, you could already achieve a lot. In addition, clamp()-function helped me not only with font-sizes, but also with the scaling of images and spacing.

### Continued development

ðŸ”Ž In the future, I would also like to learn more about tricks and tips for smooth transitions between different output devices to achieve a responsive design.

### Useful resources

- [background-image](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-image) - This helped me for designing the footer-background.
- [background-blend-mode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-blend-mode) - I didn't use it this time, but saw the possibilities of the different effects.
